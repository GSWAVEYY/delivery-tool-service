# DeliveryBridge Legal Framework

## Phase 1: Smart Launcher (Current)
- Deep links only — zero credential storage
- No CFAA risk, no ToS violations
- Standard privacy policy + terms of service required

## Phase 2: Credential Vault (Future)
- Password manager model (user-initiated storage)
- AES-256-GCM encryption, zero-knowledge architecture
- CCPA compliance: credentials = "sensitive personal information"
- Requires: written service provider contracts, annual audits, 12-month reauthorization

## Phase 3: Official API Integrations (Future)
- OAuth 2.0 first (Plaid model)
- Partner with DoorDash, Instacart, Uber Eats developer programs
- Gold standard — fully legal with official access

## Entity Structure
- Delaware LLC (bootstrap phase)
- Convert to C-Corp if/when raising venture capital

## Insurance
- Tech E&O + Cyber Liability (~$91/month)
- General Liability (~$50-100/month)

## Key Principles
1. Never store credentials without explicit user authorization
2. Use OAuth wherever possible
3. Get explicit consent, annual reauthorization
4. Stay as a tool provider — no employer relationship
