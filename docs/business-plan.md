# DeliveryBridge Business Plan

## Problem
Delivery hubs subcontracting from multiple companies (Amazon DSP, FedEx Ground, LaserShip, etc.) force employees to juggle 3+ separate apps daily.

## Solution
Single app where delivery workers search their company, authenticate, and manage all subcontracted company logins from one place.

## Business Model

### Free Tier (Workers)
- Unified dashboard + quick-switch between platforms
- Basic earnings overview

### Premium ($4.99-9.99/month)
- Advanced analytics, AI shift recommendations
- Tax deduction calculator, multi-device sync

### B2B SaaS (Delivery Hubs)
- $15-30/user/month per driver managed
- Admin dashboard, compliance tracking, fleet analytics
- Tiers: Starter ($99/mo) → Pro ($299/mo) → Enterprise

## Year 1 Revenue Target
- 1,000 free users → 50 premium = $250-500/mo
- 10 hubs × 20 drivers × $20/seat = $4,000/mo
- Target: $5,000-10,000 MRR

## Go-to-Market
1. Glenn's cousin's hub = first case study
2. Reddit communities + TikTok/Instagram content
3. $5 referral credits for viral growth
4. Cold outreach to delivery hubs (B2B phase)
5. Platform partnerships (DoorDash, Instacart developer programs)
